### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
he/him

My name is Teddy, I'm a 16 year old developer. I got my start on Roblox using their sandboxing engine to put together silly things. Roblox is how I got my start.

## Languages I Know
- Lua
- Javascript
- SQL
- Vue (not really a langauge but...)

### What I'm working on.
I'm working on various projects. Primarily I'm working on restarting my roblox-based company [Interlab](https://github.com/interlab-org). This company is working on creating various web-based products for roblox users and developers.

### âš¡ Fun fact:
If it wasn't for me accidentially stumbling apon roblox in 2014, I would have never started programming.
